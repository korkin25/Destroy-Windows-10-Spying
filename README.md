## ⚠️ Project is unmaintained! ⚠️
-----------------
Hello!

Since a while ago, this project stays unmaintained. Additionally, this project has become very and very outdated. So, use it on old systems only and **use it at your own risk**.
- Windows 10 got a lot of updates which possibly added lots of new spyware, and additionally, Windows 11 was out and needs a lot of further investigation to get it supported.
- I don't use Windows as a primary OS by myself since the end of 2014 (I moved to [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) distribution).
- There is a lot of other similar projects that has better support and are actively maintained.
- Nobody around the team (including me) has any interest on supporting this project.

So, this project lost all its sense and will be closed.

Everything will stay open for historical purposes, or if somebody wants to pick this up for attempts to craft something brand-new.

Thank you all for the support, I wish you good luck in all future works!
